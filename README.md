# outlook-scripts
A few outlook scripts to make life easier.

## clearAndSetReminders.vba: 
clears reminders on all-day meetings with reminders, and forces reminders on non-all-day meetings that don't carry reminders.  

## outlook2ical.js: 
Exports an outlook calendar in ics format for export to dropbox or something like that, for eventual sync to iphone's calendar app.  Best to run on a schedule, every 15 mins.

## CountAndSizeOutlookEmailsBySender.vba:

Creates an Excel sheet with count and total size of outlook emails by sender.  Helps find emails from prolific/large senders, because Outlook can't group by conversation size.
